# mp4_conv_assistant
Making a utility to start in a specified directory of movie files (.avi and .mkv) and convert them to mp4 using avconv. I want it to recursively do so. I also want to set them with new permissions using chmod.

Preferable to keep the old .mkv and .avi files- even move them to a temporary directory to check before deleting them.
